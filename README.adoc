= PWA Starter for Enonic XP

:linkattrs:

This Starter enables you to build a basic application with PWA capabilities on Enonic XP Platform. It's using modern tools like link:https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack^]
for the build process and link:https://workboxjs.org/[Workbox^] for automatic generation of Service Worker file and dynamic response caching. Simple routing is
powered by link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-router[Enonic Router library^].

== Installation

1.Make sure you have Enonic XP of version 6.12 or later installed locally. If not, http://xp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getstarted/other.html#download-enonic-xp[read how to install it here]:

2.Set up environment variable XP_INSTALL that points to the XP installation folder:

==== OSX/Linux

`export XP_INSTALL=/Users/ase/Downloads/enonic-xp-6.13.0-SNAPSHOT`

==== Windows

`set XP_INSTALL=/Users/ase/Downloads/enonic-xp-6.13.0-SNAPSHOT`

3.Create a new folder for your application

4.Initialize the app based on this Starter kit by running the following command (for more info on project initialisation,
read http://xp.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference/toolbox/init-project.html[the documentation for init-project])

==== OSX/Linux

`$XP_INSTALL/toolbox/toolbox.sh init-project -n com.company.myapp -r starter-pwa`

==== Windows

`$XP_INSTALL/toolbox/toolbox.bat init-project -n com.company.myapp -r starter-pwa`

TIP: Replace ``com.company.myapp`` with a unique name of your app.

5.You can now build the app by running the following from inside the app's folder:
[source,groovy]
----
gradlew build deploy
----

6.If the build completed without errors you will have a new jar file in the `<$XP_INSTALL>/home/deploy` folder.


== Usage and Testing of PWA

We assume that XP service is running on ``localhost:8000`` and your app is called ``com.company.myapp`` as in example above.

1. Open http://localhost:8080/app/com.company.myapp in your browser. You should see this:

image::mainpage-online.png[]

2.Click the "About" link in the header to open http://localhost:8080/app/com.company.myapp/about. You should see this:

image::about-online.png[]

3.Now's the fun part. Go offline (either by turning off the Wi-Fi or unplugging cable or checking off "Offline" in the Dev Tools).
Content of the About page should now change like this:

image::about-offline.png[]

4.Go back to the main page. It should now look like this:

image::mainpage-offline.png[]

As you can see, the Starter can track its online/offline status and change content of its pages accordingly.

*You are now ready to expand the application's functionality, plug in any Front-end framework etc.*

== Webpack Config

The Starter is using Webpack to build all LESS files into one CSS bundle (``bundle.css``) and all Javascript assets into one JS bundle
(``bundle.js``). The Workbox plugin is used by Webpack to automatically generate a template for the Service Worker (``sw-template.js``) based
on a predefined file (``sw-template.js``). Final Service Worker file will be rendered on-the-fly by https://github.com/enonic/lib-router[Enonic Router] lib by intercepting
a call to ``/sw.js`` file in the site root.

.webpack.config.js:

[source,javascript]
----
const path = require('path');
const extractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');
const workboxPlugin = require('workbox-webpack-plugin');

const paths = {
    assets: 'src/main/resources/assets/',
    buildAssets: 'build/resources/main/assets/',
    buildPwaLib: 'build/resources/main/lib/pwa/'
};

const assetsPath = path.join(__dirname, paths.assets);
const buildAssetsPath = path.join(__dirname, paths.buildAssets);
const buildPwaLibPath = path.join(__dirname, paths.buildPwaLib);

module.exports = {

    entry: path.join(assetsPath, 'js/main.js'),

    output: {
        path: buildAssetsPath,
        filename: 'precache/bundle.js'
    },

    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.less']
    },

    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /.less$/,
                loader: extractTextPlugin.extract({
                    fallback: 'style-loader',
                    use: "css-loader!less-loader"
                })
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new extractTextPlugin('precache/bundle.css'),
        new workboxPlugin({
            globDirectory: buildAssetsPath,
            globPatterns: ['precache/**\/*'],
            globIgnores: [],
            swSrc: path.join(assetsPath, 'js/sw-dev.js'),
            swDest: path.join(buildPwaLibPath, 'sw-template.js')
        })
    ]

};
----

== Dependencies

``js/main.js`` is used as entry point for the Webpack builder, so make sure you add first level of dependencies to this file (using ``require``).
For example, if ``js/main.js`` is using a LESS file called ``styles.less``, add the following line to the ``main.js``:

[source,javascript]
----
require('../css/styles.less');
----

Same with JS-dependencies. For example, to include a file called ``about.js`` from the same ``js`` folder add this line to ``main.js``:

[source,javascript]
----
require('../js/about.js');
----

You can then require other LESS or JS files directly from ``about.js`` effectively building a chain of dependencies that Webpack will resolve during the build.

As mentioned before, the build process will bundle all LESS and JS assets into bundle.css and bundle.js files in the ``precache`` folder which can then
be referenced directly from the ``main.html`` page.


== Auto-precaching assets

When the application is launched for the first time, Service Worker will attempt to precache the Application Shell - the minimum set of assets
required for the application to continue working while offline. As described above, two files - ``bundle.css`` and ``bundle.js`` - generated by the build
process will be precached by default. In addition, you may add any files to the ``assets/precache`` folder and they will *automatically* be added
to the list of precached assets. Typically that would be images, icons, font files, 3rd-party stylesheets and Javascript libraries etc.

.sw-dev.js:
[source,javascript]
----
importScripts('https://unpkg.com/workbox-sw@2.0.1/build/importScripts/workbox-sw.prod.v2.0.1.js');

const workboxSW = new self.WorkboxSW({
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true
});

workboxSW.precache([]);
----

Empty square brackets in The last line is the placeholder which after the build will be filled with paths to actual assets from the
``precache`` folder, something like this:

[source,javascript]
----

workboxSW.precache([
  {
    "url": "precache/bundle.css",
    "revision": "1b451da7e8b3ac2ba02b18e9bfa41fd3"
  },
  {
    "url": "precache/bundle.js",
    "revision": "610b07928b24eaf801d3d37b43256471"
  }
]);
----

== Precaching custom assets

Sometimes you may need to cache assets outside of the ``precache`` folder. In this case you have to explicitly specify the assets that you
need to be cached (this can be a local asset or an external URL). Add a new line with a call to ``workboxSW.precache`` after the one with empty placeholder:

.sw-dev.js:
[source,javascript]
----
importScripts('https://unpkg.com/workbox-sw@2.0.1/build/importScripts/workbox-sw.prod.v2.0.1.js');

const workboxSW = new self.WorkboxSW({
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true
});

workboxSW.precache([]);

workboxSW.precache([
    '{{baseUrl}}/manifest.json',
    'https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons',
    'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js'
]);
----


== Application Manifest file

*Application Manifest* is a file in JSON format which turns the application into a PWA. Starter comes with its own manifest.json with hardcoded
title, color scheme, display settings and favicon. Feel free to change the predefined settings: the file is located directly in the ``/assets/`` folder.

.manifest.json:
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "PWA Starter for Enonic XP",
  "short_name": "PWA Starter",
  "theme_color": "#FFF",
  "background_color": "#FFF",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": ".?source=web_app_manifest",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "precache/icons/icon.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
----

== Changing favicon

Default favicon used by the Starter is called ``icon.png`` and located in ``precache/icons/`` folder, so you can simply replace this icon with
your own of the same name. If you want to use a different icon file, add it to the same location and change ``main.html`` to point to the new icon. Don't
forget to make same changes in ``manifest.json`` and ``browserconfig.xml``.

.main.html:
[source,html]
----
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="{{precacheUrl}}/icons/myicon.ico">
    <link rel="icon" href="{{precacheUrl}}/icons/myicon.ico">
----

== main.js

This Starter is not a traditional site with plain HTML pages - everything is driven by a controller.
Just like ``resources/assets/js/main.js`` is an entry point of the Starter's client-side bundle, ``resources/main.js`` is an entry point
and the main controller for the server-side execution. Setting it up is simple - just add handler of the GET request to ``main.js`` file and
return response in form of rendered template or a simple string:

.main.js:
[source,html]
----
exports.get = function (req) {
    return {
        body: 'We are live'
    }
};
----

If your application name is ``com.enonic.starter.pwa`` and Enonic web server is launched on ``localhost:8000`` then
``http://localhost:8080/app/com.enonic.starter.pwa/`` will open the main page of your app.

== Dynamic routing

If your application is not a single-page app, you are going to need some routing capabilities. The Starter is using Enonic Router library
which makes it incredibly simple to dynamically route a request to correct page template.
First, let's change the default page to render a proper template instead of a simple string. Let's say, we have a ``main.html`` template in the
``/resources/pages/``.

.main.js:
[source,html]
----
var mustacheLib = require('/lib/xp/mustache');
var router = require('/lib/router')();

router.get('/', function (req) {
    return {
        body: mustacheLib.render(resolve('/pages/main.html'), {})
    }
});

exports.get = function (req) {
    return router.dispatch(req);
};

----

Here we told the Router to respond to the "/" request (which is the app's main page) with the rendered template from ``/pages/main.html``.

Now let's expand this to enable routing to other pages. Let's say, we need two pages called _"About"_ and _"Contact"_ which should open via ``/about`` and
``/contact`` URLs correspondingly.

.main.js:
[source,html]
----
var mustacheLib = require('/lib/xp/mustache');
var router = require('/lib/router')();

router.get('/', function (req) {
    return {
        body: mustacheLib.render(resolve('/pages/main.html'), {})
    }
});

router.get('/about', function (req) {
    return {
        body: mustacheLib.render(resolve('/pages/about.html'), {})
    }
});

router.get('/contact', function (req) {
    return {
        body: mustacheLib.render(resolve('/pages/contact.html'), {})
    }
});

exports.get = function (req) {
    return router.dispatch(req);
};

----

That's it, we have just built a simple routing inside the ``main.js`` file. You can pass custom rendering parameters to each template inside the {} argument.

== Response caching

When you're building a PWA you typically want a user to be able to open previously visited pages even when the application is offline.
In this Starter we are using Workbox to dynamically cache URL requests for future use.

.sw-dev.js:
[source,javascript]
----
importScripts('https://unpkg.com/workbox-sw@2.0.1/build/importScripts/workbox-sw.prod.v2.0.1.js');

const workboxSW = new self.WorkboxSW({
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true
});

workboxSW.router.registerRoute(
    '{{baseUrl}}/about',
    workboxSW.strategies.networkFirst()
);

workboxSW.router.registerRoute(
    '{{baseUrl}}/contact',
    workboxSW.strategies.networkFirst()
);

workboxSW.router.registerRoute(
    /^https:\/\/fonts\.gstatic\.com\//,
    workboxSW.strategies.cacheFirst()
);
----

Here we cache requests to the ``/about`` and ``/contact`` URLs mentioned above, as well as request to the 3rd-party font file on an external URL.

NOTE: Note that we are using _networkFirst_ strategy for the pages where we first check for the fresh version from the network and fall back to the cached version if the network is down.
Read more about possible caching strategies https://workboxjs.org/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-runtime-caching.html[here].
